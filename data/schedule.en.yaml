              \ Congwei Song\n\nintro:\nAfter Learning many computer languages, many people\
              \ may have the idea of designing their own computer language. The key task\
              \ is to design the language's grammar parser. Most current languages are parsed\
              \ based on context-independent grammars. The expression parsing grammar PEG,\
              \ a potential substitute for context-independent grammars, can also be implemented\
              \ as a parser for computer languages and has many advantages that formal grammars\
              \ do not have, such as ease of implementation, fast parsing, and no ambiguity.\
              \ In addition, experts are experimenting with implementing Python parsers\
              \ with PEGs. pyparsing is an easy-to-use PEG package for Python. The main\
              \ goal of the presentation is to demonstrate how to design parsers with pyparsing.\
              \ It will cover PEG principles and parser implementation techniques, the pyparsing\
              \ design style, a demonstration of a computer language of your own design,\
              \ and a series of interesting examples.\n\n\n### Natural Language-guided Programming\n\
              \nspeaker: Geert Heyman\n\nintro:\nI will present an “AI pair programmer”\
              \ research prototype from Nokia Bell Labs that aims to assist Python developers\
              \ to work with open\n  source libraries for data science. Our AI assistant\
              \ for Jupyter notebooks\n  auto-completes Python code based on natural language\
              \ intent, a practice we\n  call “natural language-guided programming”. That\
              \ is, by writing a short\n  inline comment in their code (e.g., “plot this\
              \ data in a bar chart”),\n  developers can query the AI for a contextualized\
              \ code snippet that implements\n  their intent.\n \nI will explain on a high-level\
              \ how we trained the machine learning model that sits at the core of the AI\
              \ pair programmer. This will give guidance on\n  how to optimally use this\
              \ next-generation autocompletion tool and will help\n  in understanding its\
              \ current limitations and pitfalls. The machine learning\n  model that we\
              \ trained is published on the Hugging Face model hub and is small\n  enough\
              \ to be deployed without an exuberant amount of computational resources.\n\

              \ its rich ecology and simple syntax is favored by many people, and widely\
              \ practiced in artificial intelligence, scientific computing, Web development\
              \ and other fields, this sharing I will introduce the application of API gateway\
              \ through Python combined with Apache APISIX. In order to achieve non-invasive\
              \ development of Apache APISIX plugins through Python in the community, we\
              \ have developed an Apache APISIX Python Runner project that allows developers\
              \ to use Python to develop Apache APISIX plugins without having to pay attention\
              \ to Nginx C and Lua implementation details, just focus on the business logic\
              \ of the Python plugin.\nI will also share a case study to demonstrate how\
              \ to develop and apply an Apache APISIX plugin to Apache APISIX with a few\
              \ lines of Python code."

              \n\r\nspeaker: Nan Wang\r\n\r\nintro:\r\nThis talk focuses on how we help\
              \ the Jina Hub developer community balance development efficiency and maintainability\
              \ through the use of the Python native Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) module in\
              \ Jina Hub, which is designed to provide developers with the various Executors\
              \ needed to build neural search systems using Jina. Not only can developers\
              \ find the Executor they need at Jina Hub, but they can also publish custom\
              \ Executors and share them with the entire community. By using the ast module\
              \ to parse developers' code, we automate and standardize the generation and\
              \ management of Dockerfiles and installation dependencies, allowing developers\
              \ to focus more on the core functionality of the Executor. In addition, we\
              \ use the ast module to help developers automatically generate Executor details\
              \ to further facilitate sharing with the community. ast allows us to lower\
              \ the development threshold and attract more developers to join the Jina Hub\
              \ community by improving the maintainability of the code while ensuring the\
              \ efficiency of community development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Identifying genes with\
              \ AI, starting with vectorized DNA sequences\r\n\r\nspeaker: Mengjia Gu\r\n\
              \r\nintro:\r\nDNA sequences have a wide range of applications in molecular\
              \ biology and medical research, such as gene tracing, species identification,\
              \ and disease diagnosis. If a large number of samples are taken in combination\
              \ with the emerging genetic big data, the experimental results are usually\
              \ more convincing and can be put into real-world applications more effectively.\
              \ However, traditional nucleic acid sequence matching methods have many limitations\
              \ and are not applicable to large scale data, which makes real world applications\
              \ have to make a trade-off between cost and accuracy. To alleviate the constraints\
              \ of nucleic acid sequence data characteristics, vectorization is a better\
              \ choice for large amounts of DNA sequences. The implementation of DNA sequence\
              \ vectorization can improve efficiency while helping to reduce the cost of\
              \ research projects or system builds.\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we tried\
              \ to build a gene sequence classification system by combining NLP models and\
              \ Milvus, an open source vector database. Tested with experimental data based\
              \ on Milvus' python SDK, we found that the system not only identifies gene\
              \ classes in milliseconds, but is also more accurate than common classifiers\
              \ in the field of machine learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Binary Vulnerability Mining\
              \ in Python Security Testing\r\n\r\nspeaker: Ralph Wu\r\n\r\nintro:\r\nIn\
              \ security testing, binary vulnerability mining is often combined with Python,\
              \ which can better combine ELF programs under Linux with Python; this lecture\r\
              \n  mainly introduces the use of Python's \"pwntools\" framework in\r\n  CTF-pwn\
              \ to write examples of vulnerability exploitation examples and crack\r\n \
              \ programs Get the host's permission; in the form of vulnerabilities, show\
              \ how\r\n  to use Python to deal with the \"charm\" of binary security branches\r\
              \n  in the security field."

            desc: Deep learning has been adopted in more and more industries in the recent
              10 years. It changes the human society much more than the past years. So what
              kind of problems could it be leveraged at? How to open the door of deep learning,
              where should I start as a beginner? In the sharing, I will introduce the process
              of deep learning, some important fundamental math background. and will talk
              about how neural network works in deep learning. And will demo how to build
              a neural network, and how to design different level algorithm for the network.
              Last but not least, how to set up a production service for a neural network.

              can easily build dynamic reports, while echarts' rich legends make data representation
              more vivid and intuitive. This session will quickly introduce the basic methods
              of using dash and echarts together, and provide step by step instructions
              for creating complex charts such as maps, so that you can quickly master the
              use of dash and echarts.
