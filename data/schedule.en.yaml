        \ Congwei Song\n\nintro:\nAfter Learning many computer languages, many people\
        \ may have the idea of designing their own computer language. The key task\
        \ is to design the language's grammar parser. Most current languages are parsed\
        \ based on context-independent grammars. The expression parsing grammar PEG,\
        \ a potential substitute for context-independent grammars, can also be implemented\
        \ as a parser for computer languages and has many advantages that formal grammars\
        \ do not have, such as ease of implementation, fast parsing, and no ambiguity.\
        \ In addition, experts are experimenting with implementing Python parsers\
        \ with PEGs. pyparsing is an easy-to-use PEG package for Python. The main\
        \ goal of the presentation is to demonstrate how to design parsers with pyparsing.\
        \ It will cover PEG principles and parser implementation techniques, the pyparsing\
        \ design style, a demonstration of a computer language of your own design,\
        \ and a series of interesting examples.\n\n\n### Natural Language-guided Programming\n\

        \ research prototype from Nokia Bell Labs that aims to assist Python developers\
        \ to work with open\n  source libraries for data science. Our AI assistant\
        \ for Jupyter notebooks\n  auto-completes Python code based on natural language\
        \ intent, a practice we\n  call “natural language-guided programming”. That\
        \ is, by writing a short\n  inline comment in their code (e.g., “plot this\
        \ data in a bar chart”),\n  developers can query the AI for a contextualized\
        \ code snippet that implements\n  their intent.\n \nI will explain on a high-level\
        \ how we trained the machine learning model that sits at the core of the AI\
        \ pair programmer. This will give guidance on\n  how to optimally use this\
        \ next-generation autocompletion tool and will help\n  in understanding its\
        \ current limitations and pitfalls. The machine learning\n  model that we\
        \ trained is published on the Hugging Face model hub and is small\n  enough\
        \ to be deployed without an exuberant amount of computational resources.\n\

      desc: "### How the ast module helps Jina Hub developers develop efficiently\r\
        \n\r\nspeaker: Nan Wang\r\n\r\nintro:\r\nThis talk focuses on how we help\
        \ the Jina Hub developer community balance development efficiency and maintainability\
        \ through the use of the Python native Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) module in\
        \ Jina Hub, which is designed to provide developers with the various Executors\
        \ needed to build neural search systems using Jina. Not only can developers\
        \ find the Executor they need at Jina Hub, but they can also publish custom\
        \ Executors and share them with the entire community. By using the ast module\
        \ to parse developers' code, we automate and standardize the generation and\
        \ management of Dockerfiles and installation dependencies, allowing developers\
        \ to focus more on the core functionality of the Executor. In addition, we\
        \ use the ast module to help developers automatically generate Executor details\
        \ to further facilitate sharing with the community. ast allows us to lower\
        \ the development threshold and attract more developers to join the Jina Hub\
        \ community by improving the maintainability of the code while ensuring the\
        \ efficiency of community development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Identifying genes with\
        \ AI, starting with vectorized DNA sequences\r\n\r\nspeaker: Mengjia Gu\r\n\
        \r\nintro:\r\nDNA sequences have a wide range of applications in molecular\
        \ biology and medical research, such as gene tracing, species identification,\
        \ and disease diagnosis. If a large number of samples are taken in combination\
        \ with the emerging genetic big data, the experimental results are usually\
        \ more convincing and can be put into real-world applications more effectively.\
        \ However, traditional nucleic acid sequence matching methods have many limitations\
        \ and are not applicable to large scale data, which makes real world applications\
        \ have to make a trade-off between cost and accuracy. To alleviate the constraints\
        \ of nucleic acid sequence data characteristics, vectorization is a better\
        \ choice for large amounts of DNA sequences. The implementation of DNA sequence\
        \ vectorization can improve efficiency while helping to reduce the cost of\
        \ research projects or system builds.\r\n\r\nBased on this idea, we tried\
        \ to build a gene sequence classification system by combining NLP models and\
        \ Milvus, an open source vector database. Tested with experimental data based\
        \ on Milvus' python SDK, we found that the system not only identifies gene\
        \ classes in milliseconds, but is also more accurate than common classifiers\
        \ in the field of machine learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Binary Vulnerability Mining\
        \ in Python Security Testing\r\n\r\nspeaker: Ralph Wu\r\n\r\nintro:\r\nIn\
        \ security testing, binary vulnerability mining is often combined with Python,\
        \ which can better combine ELF programs under Linux with Python; this lecture\r\
        \n  mainly introduces the use of Python's \"pwntools\" framework in\r\n  CTF-pwn\
        \ to write examples of vulnerability exploitation examples and crack\r\n \
        \ programs Get the host's permission; in the form of vulnerabilities, show\
        \ how\r\n  to use Python to deal with the \"charm\" of binary security branches\r\

      desc: "As business innovation accelerates in the era of digital intelligence\
        \ and automation, increasingly complex architectures and huge data volumes\
        \ have placed higher demands on centralized big data platforms. On the other\
        \ hand, how to quickly build applications, processes, and business solutions\
        \ continue to accumulate, which has led to the explosion of Low-Code products\
        \ in various fields in the past two years, and their related technologies\
        \ are also applicable under the observability platform.\nThis session introduces\
        \ how to use low-code technologies (Python as an example) in building observability\
        \ platforms to innovate the experience of using products and improve the flexibility\
        \ of scenarios and engineering efficiency of solutions. The presentation will\
        \ cover the key aspects of flexible data collection and processing, intelligent\
        \ analysis, monitoring and alerting, and response automation, involving cloud-native,\
        \ stream batch computing, OLAP, DSL, orchestration and templating technologies.\n\
        Presentation outline. 1:\n1. background overview of observability and low-code\
        \ technologies\n2. technical challenges, architecture design and technical\
        \ difficulties in each aspect of the observability platform \n3. best practices\
